# Tibbles and filters

As you may remember from the 
[Intermediate R workshop](https://chryswoods.com/intermediate_r/tidyverse.html),
R is great at representing and manipulating tabular data.
In "traditional" R, this was handled in `data.frame`, while
in modern "tidyverse" R this is handled via a `tibble`.

A `tibble` is a two (or possibly more) dimensional table of data.

```R
library(tidyverse)

census <- tibble("City" = c("Paris", "Paris", "Paris", "Paris",
                          "London", "London", "London", "London",
                          "Rome", "Rome", "Rome", "Rome"),
                 "year" = c(2001, 2008, 2009, 2010,
                          2001, 2006, 2011, 2015,
                          2001, 2006, 2009, 2012),
                 "pop" = c(2.148, 2.211, 2.234, 2.244,
                         7.322, 7.657, 8.174, 8.615,
                         2.547, 2.627, 2.734, 2.627))
```

This has created a `tibble` that we have assigned to the variable `census`.
The column names are the keys (`City`, `year` and `pop`), while the 
data for each column is given in the values (the lists).

You can print a summary of the tibble via;

```R
census
```

This will output

```
City    year    pop
<chr>   <dbl>   <dbl>
Paris	2001	2.148		
Paris	2008	2.211		
Paris	2009	2.234		
Paris	2010	2.244		
London	2001	7.322		
London	2006	7.657		
London	2011	8.174		
London	2015	8.615		
Rome	2001	2.547		
Rome	2006	2.627
```

Note that R will default to interpreting numbers as floating point (`dbl`). While
this is correct for the `pop` (population) column, this is the wrong choice for 
the year. A better choice would be an integer. To force this, use `as.integer`
to set the data type for the year column;

```R
census <- tibble("City" = c("Paris", "Paris", "Paris", "Paris",
                          "London", "London", "London", "London",
                          "Rome", "Rome", "Rome", "Rome"),
                 "year" = as.integer(c(2001, 2008, 2009, 2010,
                                     2001, 2006, 2011, 2015,
                                     2001, 2006, 2009, 2012)),
                 "pop" = c(2.148, 2.211, 2.234, 2.244,
                         7.322, 7.657, 8.174, 8.615,
                         2.547, 2.627, 2.734, 2.627))

census
```

will print

```
City    year    pop
<chr>   <int>   <dbl>
Paris   2001    2.148
Paris   2008    2.211
Paris   2009    2.234
Paris   2010    2.244
London  2001    7.322
London  2006    7.657
London  2011    8.174
London  2015    8.615
Rome    2001    2.547
Rome    2006    2.627
```

You access the contents of a `tibble` mostly by column, e.g.

```R
census["City"]
```

will return a `tibble` of just a single column containing the `City` data.

You can also access the columns by their index, e.g.

```R
census[1]
```

will return the first column, so is identical to `census["City"]`.

You can also extract multiple columns by specifying them via `c( )`, e.g.

```R
census[c("City", "year")]
```

will return a `tibble` with the `City` and `year` columns.

To access data by rows, you need to pass in the row index followed by a comma, e.g.

```R
census[1, ]
```

will return a `tibble` containing just the first row of data.

You can use ranges to get several rows, e.g.

```R
census[1:5, ]
```

would return the first five rows, while

```R
census[seq(2, 10, 2), ]
```

would return the even rows from 2 to 10.

You can access specific rows and columns via `[row, column]`, e.g.

```R
census[1, 1]
```

returns a `tibble` containing just the first row and first column, while

```R
census[seq(2, 10, 2), "year"]
```

would return the `year` column of the even rows from 2 to 10, and

```R
census[5, 2:3]
```

would return the second and third columns of the fifth row.

The above functions all return a `tibble` that is a subset of the whole `tibble`. You 
can extract the data for a single column as a list via `[[ ]]` or `$`, e.g.

```R
census[[1]]
census[["City"]]
census$City
```

and can then extract data from those lists via sub-indexing, e.g.

```R
census$City[1]
```

would return the `City` column data for the first row.

## Querying

We can start to ask questions of our data using the `filter` function.

```R
census %>% filter(City == "Paris")
```

```
City   year   pop
<chr> <int> <dbl>
Paris  2001  2.15
Paris  2008  2.21
Paris  2009  2.23
Paris  2010  2.24
```

(note that we didn't need to put double quotes around `City` in the filter - 
it knows that this is a column name. Also, 
[look here](https://chryswoods.com/intermediate_r/magrittr) if you need
to refresh your knowledge of the `%>%` operator).

This has returned a new `tibble`, which you can then access using the same
methods as above, e.g.

```R
(census %>% filter(City == "Paris"))["year"]
```

You can also test if the rows of a `tibble` match a condition, e.g.

```R
census["City"] == "Paris"
```

returns a set of `TRUE` / `FALSE` values for each row, depending on whether
the `City` value of that row was equal to `Paris`.

```
      City
 [1,]  TRUE
 [2,]  TRUE
 [3,]  TRUE
 [4,]  TRUE
 [5,] FALSE
 [6,] FALSE
 [7,] FALSE
 [8,] FALSE
 [9,] FALSE
[10,] FALSE
[11,] FALSE
[12,] FALSE
```

## Adding new columns

New columns can be added to a `tibble` simply by assigning them by 
index (as you would for a dictionary);

```R
census["continental"] <- census["City"] != "London"
census
```

```  
 City   year   pop continental
 chr>  <int> <dbl> <lgl>      
 Paris   2001  2.15 TRUE       
 Paris   2008  2.21 TRUE       
 Paris   2009  2.23 TRUE       
 Paris   2010  2.24 TRUE       
 London  2001  7.32 FALSE      
 London  2006  7.66 FALSE      
 London  2011  8.17 FALSE      
 London  2015  8.62 FALSE      
 Rome    2001  2.55 TRUE       
 Rome    2006  2.63 TRUE       
 Rome    2009  2.73 TRUE       
 Rome    2012  2.63 TRUE
```
