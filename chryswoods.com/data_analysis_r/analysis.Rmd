# Data analysis

Up to this point, we have just been learning how to read data and
make it "tidy". This was a lot of work. The pay-off is that now
the analysis of the data will be much easier and straightforward.

This is intentional. Data cleaning is the messiest and most ambiguous
part of data science. A truism is that data cleaning takes 80%
of the time of any data science project. However, without this
effort, data analysis and visualisation would be similarly messy
and time consuming. By cleaning first, we can perform data analysis
and visualisation using clean, consistent, well-tested and tidy
tools.

## Analysis via `summarise`

You can perform summary analysis on data in a tibble using the 
[summarise](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise.html)
function from the [dply](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org) package.

`summarise` will create a new tibble that is a summary of the input
tibble, based on grouping and a summarising function. Summarising
functions include;

* Center: [mean()](https://rdrr.io/r/base/mean.html), [median()](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/median.html)
* Spread: [sd()](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/sd.html), [IQR()](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/IQR.html), [mad()](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/mad.html)
* Range: [min()](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Extremes.html), [max()](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Extremes.html), [quantile()](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/quantile.html)
* Position: [first()](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/nth.html), [last()](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/nth.html), [nth()](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/nth.html)
* Count: [n()](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/context.html), [n_distinct()](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/n_distinct.html)
* Logical: [any()](https://rdrr.io/r/base/any.html), [all()](https://rdrr.io/r/base/all.html)

For example, we can calculate the mean average temperature using;

```R
historical_temperature %>% 
    summarise("average temperature" = mean(temperature))
```

```
# A tibble: 1 x 1
  `average temperature`
                  <dbl>
1                  9.25
```

This has created a new tibble, where the column called "average temperature"
contains the mean average temperature.

## Grouping data

Each row of tidy data corresponds to a single observation. 
We can group observations together into groups using
[group_by](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/group_by.html).
We can then feed these groups into summaries.

For example, we can group by year and summarise by the mean
function to calculate the average temperature for each year;

```R
historical_temperature %>% 
    group_by(year) %>%
    summarise("average temperature" = mean(temperature))
```

```
# A tibble: 362 x 2
    year `average temperature`
   <int>                 <dbl>
 1  1659                  8.83
 2  1660                  9.08
 3  1661                  9.75
 4  1662                  9.5 
 5  1663                  8.58
 6  1664                  9.33
 7  1665                  8.25
 8  1666                  9.83
 9  1667                  8.5 
10  1668                  9.5 
# â€¦ with 352 more rows
```

or, we could calculate the average temperature for each month via;

```R
historical_temperature %>%
    group_by(month) %>%
    summarise("average temperature" = mean(temperature))
```

```
# A tibble: 12 x 2
   month `average temperature`
   <fct>                 <dbl>
 1 JAN                    3.28
 2 FEB                    3.89
 3 MAR                    5.35
 4 APR                    7.95
 5 MAY                   11.2 
 6 JUN                   14.3 
 7 JUL                   16.0 
 8 AUG                   15.6 
 9 SEP                   13.3 
10 OCT                    9.73
11 NOV                    6.08
12 DEC                    4.12
```

## Filtering data

We can then use the [filter](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html),
also from dplyr, to filter observations (rows) before we group. For example,
we could filter the years in the 18th Century (`year < 1800 & year >= 1700`)
and calculate the average monthly temperatures then via;

```R
historical_temperature %>%
    filter(year < 1800 & year >= 1700) %>%
    group_by(month) %>%
    summarise("18th Century" = mean(temperature))
```

```
# A tibble: 12 x 2
   month `18th Century`
   <fct>          <dbl>
 1 JAN             2.89
 2 FEB             3.80
 3 MAR             5.04
 4 APR             7.88
 5 MAY            11.3 
 6 JUN            14.5 
 7 JUL            16.0 
 8 AUG            15.8 
 9 SEP            13.5 
10 OCT             9.40
11 NOV             5.84
12 DEC             3.89
```

We could then repeat this for the 21st Century...

```R
historical_temperature %>%
    filter(year >= 2000) %>%
    group_by(month) %>%
    summarise("21st Century" = mean(temperature))
```

```
# A tibble: 12 x 2
   month `21st Century`
   <fct>          <dbl>
 1 JAN             4.73
 2 FEB             4.93
 3 MAR             6.60
 4 APR             9.08
 5 MAY            12.0 
 6 JUN            14.9 
 7 JUL            16.8 
 8 AUG            16.4 
 9 SEP            14.3 
10 OCT            11.2 
11 NOV             7.44
12 DEC             5.12
```

Because we were working with tidy data the filtering and grouping
of observations, and then generation of summary statistics was 
straightforward. This grammar (data is filtered, then grouped,
then summarised) worked because the data was tidy. As we will
see in the next section, a similar grammar for visualisation
makes graph drawing equally logical.
