# Reading from files

One of the most common situations is that you have some data file containing 
the data you want to read. Perhaps this is data you've produced yourself or 
maybe it's from a colleague. In an ideal world the file will be perfectly 
formatted and will be trivial to import into R but since this is so often 
not the case, R provides a number of features to make your life easier.

Full information on reading and writing is available in
[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html)
but first it's worth noting the common formats that R can work with:

* Comma-separated tables (or tab-separated, space-separated etc)
* Excel spreadsheets
* HDF5 files
* SQL databases

For this course we will focus on plain-text CSV files as they are 
perhaps the most common format. Imagine we have a CSV (comma-separated 
values) file. The example we will use today is available at
[city_pop.csv](city_pop.csv). Open that file in your browser and
you will see;

```
This is an example CSV file
The text at the top here is not part of the data but instead is here
to describe the file. You'll see this quite often in real-world data.
A -1 signifies a missing value.

year;London;Paris;Rome
2001;7.322;2.148;2.547
2006;7.652;;2.627
2008;-1;2.211;
2009;-1;2.234;2.734
2011;8.174;;
2012;-1;2.244;2.627
2015;8.615;;
```

```R
library(tidyverse)
```

We can use the tidyverse function `read_csv` to read the file and convert it to a `tibble`. 
`read_csv` is part of the [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org) package that is installed
with the tidyverse.

Full documentation for this function can be found in the manual or, as with any 
R function, directly in the notebook by putting a ? before the name:

```R
?read_csv
```

The first argument to the function is called `file`, the documentation for which begins:

```
Either a path to a file, a connection, or literal data (either a single string or a raw vector).

Files ending in .gz, .bz2, .xz, or .zip will be automatically uncompressed. Files starting 
with http://, https://, ftp://, or ftps:// will be automatically downloaded. 
Remote gz files can also be automatically downloaded and decompressed.
```

This means that we can take our URL and pass it directly (or via an object) to the function:

```R
city_pop_file <- "https://chryswoods.com/data_analysis_r/city_pop.csv"
read_csv(city_pop_file)
```

```
This is an example CSV file
<chr>
The text at the top here is not part of the data but instead is here	
to describe the file. You'll see this quite often in real-world data.	
A -1 signifies a missing value.	
year;London;Paris;Rome	
2001;7.322;2.148;2.547	
2006;7.652;;2.627	
2008;-1;2.211;	
2009;-1;2.234;2.734	
2011;8.174;;	
2012;-1;2.244;2.627
```

We can see that by default it's done a fairly bad job of parsing the file 
(this is mostly because I've constructed the `city_pop.csv` file to be as 
obtuse as possible). It's making a lot of assumptions about the structure 
of the file but in general it's taking quite a na√Øve approach.

The first thing we notice is that it's treating the text at the top of the 
file as though it's data. Checking the 
[documentation](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html)
we see that the simplest way to solve this is to use the `skip` argument 
to the function to which we give an integer giving the number of rows to skip:

```R
read_csv(
    city_pop_file,
    skip = 5
)
```

```
year;London;Paris;Rome
<chr>
2001;7.322;2.148;2.547				
2006;7.652;;2.627				
2008;-1;2.211;				
2009;-1;2.234;2.734				
2011;8.174;;				
2012;-1;2.244;2.627				
2015;8.615;;
```

The next most obvious problem is that it is not separating the columns at all. 
This is because `read_csv` is a special case of the more general `read_delim`
that sets the separator (also called the delimiter) `delim` to a comma `,`.

We can set the separator to `;` by changing to `read_delim` and setting 
`delim` equal to `;`

```R
read_delim(
    city_pop_file,
    skip = 5,
    delim = ";"
)
```

```
year    London  Paris   Rome
<dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>
2001    7.322   2.148   2.547	
2006    7.652   NA      2.627	
2008    -1.000  2.211   NA	
2009    -1.000  2.234   2.734	
2011    8.174   NA      NA	
2012    -1.000  2.244   2.627	
2015    8.615   NA      NA	
```

Now it's actually starting to look like a real table of data.

Reading the descriptive header of our data file we see that a value of `-1` 
signifies a missing reading so we should mark those too. This can be done 
after the fact but it is simplest to do it at import-time using the `na` argument:

```R
read_delim(    
    city_pop_file,
    skip = 5,
    delim = ";",
    na = "-1"
)
```

```
year    London  Paris   Rome    
<dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>
2001    7.322   2.148   2.547	
2006    7.652   NA      2.627	
2008    NA      2.211   NA	
2009    NA      2.234   2.734	
2011    8.174   NA      NA	
2012    NA      2.244   2.627	
2015    8.615   NA      NA	
```

The next issue is that you can see that the year has been read in as a
floating point (double) number, rather than as an integer. Each column
is read using a parser, that converts the text data in the file into
data of the appropriate type. `read_delim` will guess which parser to use, with
this helpfully reported to the R console;

```
Parsed with column specification:
cols(
  year = col_double(),
  London = col_double(),
  Paris = col_double(),
  Rome = col_double()
)
```

In this case, R has guessed that all of the columns contain floating point
numbers, and so it has used the `col_double()` specification, which calls the `parse_double()` 
function to convert the text from those columns from the file into numbers.

The tidyverse supplies many parsers, e.g. `parse_integer()`, `parse_date()`
etc. More detail about these parsers (including how to parse different date
formats, different number formats etc.) can be found in the free online
book [R for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html).

You can set the parser to use for a column by specifying the column 
types via the `col_types` argument. We want the `year` to be an integer,
so;

```R
read_delim(    
    city_pop_file,
    skip = 5,
    delim = ";",
    na = "-1",
    col_types = cols("year" = col_integer())
)
```

(note that `col_guess()`, which guesses the right type of data, is used
for any columns that you don't specify)

```
year    London  Paris   Rome
<int>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>
2001    7.322   2.148   2.547
2006    7.652   NA      2.627
2008    NA      2.211   NA
2009    NA      2.234   2.734
2011    8.174   NA      NA
2012    NA      2.244   2.627
2015    8.615   NA      NA
```

Finally, we want to assign this `tibble` to an object, called `census`;

```R
census <- read_delim(
    city_pop_file,
    skip = 5,
    delim = ";",
    na = "-1",
    col_types = cols("year" = col_integer())
)
```

That covers the basics of reading in data with R. For more information

check out the [documentation for readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org),
or check out the really handy official [readr cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-import.pdf).

Next we will do something useful with our data and plot it.
