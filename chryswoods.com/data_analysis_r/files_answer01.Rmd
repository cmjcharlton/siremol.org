Import the tidyverse

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Read in the file. As whitespace is the delimiter, we need to use `read_table`.
Note that `read_delim` with `delim = " "` is the wrong choice as it will try
to split on single whitespace characters. `read_table` is the right choice
for multiple whitespace separators.

Note that we should read the `DATE` as an integer, as it is a year.

```{r}
temperature <- read_table(
    "https://chryswoods.com/data_analysis_r/cetml1659on.txt",
    skip = 6,
    na = c("-99.99", "-99.9"),
    col_types = cols("DATE" = col_integer())
)
temperature
```

How many years had a negative average temperature in January?

```{r}
negative_jan <- temperature %>% filter(JAN < 0)
negative_jan
```

```{r}
num_negative_jan <- negative_jan %>% nrow()
num_negative_jan
```

What was the average temperature in June over the years in the data set?

```{r}
jun_average <- temperature %>% pull(JUN) %>% mean()
jun_average
```
