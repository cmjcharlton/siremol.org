This course is aimed at the intermediate R developer who wants to learn 
how to do useful text and sentiment analysis tasks in R. It will focus on 
"modern R", specifically using the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) 
collection of packages which are designed for data science.

Text and sentiment analysis is a huge topic and we couldn't possibly cover it 
all in one short course. The purpose of this workshop is to give you an 
introduction to some of the most useful tools and to demonstrate some of the 
most common problems that surface.

This workshop assumes you have knowledge of R equivalent to that covered
in [Beginning R](https://chryswoods.com/beginning_r),
[Intermediate R](https://chryswoods.com/intermediate_r) and
[Introduction to Data Analysis in R](https://chryswoods.com/data_analysis_r/).

You can jump ahead to any chapter:

For the purposes of this workshop we will be using RStudio. If you haven't
installed and got RStudio working, then please follow the instructions
in the [Intermediate R workshop](https://chryswoods.com/intermediate_r).

Just as in [Introduction to Data Analysis in R](https://chryswoods.com/data_analysis_r/) 
we will be writing R markdown notebooks using RStudio. Instructions on how
to do this are [given here](https://chryswoods.com/data_analysis_r/).

We will use a range of packages in this workshop. To install them, please run;

```
install.packages(c("tidyverse",
                   "tidytext",
                   "textdata",
                   "gutenbergr",
                   "wordcloud",
                   "igraph",
                   "ggraph"))
```
