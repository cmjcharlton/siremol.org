# Tokenising

The first step to analysing text in R is to convert it into a form 
that will make it easier to process. This includes tidying the text,
and arranging it into a tidy tibble.

Let's start by importing the `tidyverse` and also the 
[tidytext](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidytext/vignettes/tidytext.html)
library.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
```

Next, we need to create some text that we will analyse. Let's start
with the first few lines of Hamlet's famous soliloquy. We will create
this as a vector, with each element in the vector being one
line of the speech.

```{r}
text_lines = c("To be, or not to be--that is the question:",
         "Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer",
         "The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune",
         "Or to take arms against a sea of troubles",
         "And by opposing end them.")
```

Our next step is to convert this vector into a tibble. We want the tibble
to have two columns:

1. `line` will hold the line number. There are five lines, so this will be
   the count from `1:5`.
2. `text` will hold each line of text.

```{r}
soliloquy <- tibble(line = 1:5, text = text_lines)
soliloquy
```

We now want to rearrange this tibble into a tidy text format. Remember,
tidy data is data where;

1. every variable has its own column,
2. every observation has its own row,
3. each value must have its own cell.

So what is the "observation" when analysing text? In tidy text, an observation
is called a "token". A token is the smallest unit of text that you want
to analyse. For example, a token could be;

1. individual letters
2. individual words
3. combination of neighbouring words (n-grams)
4. individual lines
5. individual paragraphs

etc. The token is the smallest unit of text that you need to use for your
analysis, i.e. the atomic unit. It is up to you to decide what the appropriate 
token type is for your analysis. For example, if we were counting the number
of times each word appeared in the text, then the token would be a word.
If we were analysing average line lengths, then the token would be a line.

Let's count the number of times each word appears. For this analysis,
the token (and thus observation) is a word. Each observation must
have its own row, meaning that we need to transform the tibble so that
there is one word per row. But what about the first rule that 
every variable has its own column? What are the variables for this text?

There are two variables:

1. The line number, which is in the column `line`
2. The actual token (word), which we will put in a column called `word`.

We therefore need to transform our tibble so that we have two columns;
`line` and `word`. And each word should be on a separate row.

We could do this manually. Fortunately the `tidytext` library supplies
the function [unnest_tokens](https://rdrr.io/cran/tidytext/man/unnest_tokens.html),
which can automatically do this for us.

```{r}
tokens <- soliloquy |> unnest_tokens(word, text)
tokens
```

By default `unnest_tokens` will tokenise by words. You can change this
by passing different options to the function (e.g. as we will do later
when we will tokenise by n-grams). The first argument is the
name of the column in which to place the tokens, while the second
argument is the name of the column that contains the text to tokenise.

Note that `unnest_tokens` has automatically lower-cased the words
and removed punctuation.

Now that the text is tidy, it is easy to count the number of occurrences
of each word. We can do this using the 
[count](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/count.html) function
from the tidyverse's [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/index.html)
package. We will pass `sort = TRUE` so that the resulting tibble is 
sorted with the most common words at the top.

```{r}
tokens |> count(word, sort = TRUE)
```

## Reading text from a file

Tidying the text makes all subsequent analysis significantly easier. But,
of course, before we can tidy the text, we have to load it into R. 
Typing it out into a vector, as we did above, would not be practical
for large amounts of text!

Fortunately R comes with many functions to read text from files. 
The [readLines](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/readLines) 
function from core R reads text from a file into a vector of lines.
For example, I've put the whole of Hamlet's soliloquy online
at [https://chryswoods.com/text_analysis_r/hamlet.txt](https://chryswoods.com/text_analysis_r/hamlet.txt).
We can load this via;

```{r}
text_lines <- readLines("https://chryswoods.com/text_analysis_r/hamlet.txt")
text_lines
```

We will now convert this into a tibble. One column, called `line`, will
have the line number (from 1 to the number of lines), while the lines
themselves will be placed into the column called `text`.

```{r}
hamlet <- tibble(line = seq_along(text_lines), text = text_lines)
hamlet
```

We can now tokenise the text using `unnest_tokens` again, and then
count the numbers;

```{r}
hamlet_tokens <- hamlet |> unnest_tokens(word, text)
hamlet_tokens |> count(word, sort = TRUE)
```

Analysis is made difficult because the text contains lots of short words,
like "the", "of" and "and", which form the scaffolding of the sentences 
without necessarily containing meaning in and of themselves. These words,
which are often called "stop words", are sometimes not needed for 
textual analysis, and should be removed. Fortunately the tidytext library
provides a data set of English stop words;

```{r}
data(stop_words)
stop_words
```

We can remove these stop words from `hamlet_tokens` by performing an 
anti-join between `hamlet_tokens` and `stop_words`. An anti-join combines
two tibbles, returning only the rows in the first tibble that are NOT
in the second tibble. We use the [anti-join](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter-joins.html)
function that is part of [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/index.html).

```{r}
important_hamlet_tokens <- hamlet_tokens |> anti_join(stop_words)
important_hamlet_tokens
```

Now, when we count the words, we will only get the meaningful words;

```{r}
important_hamlet_tokens |> count(word, sort = TRUE)
```

The top words, "sleep", "death", "die", "life", are a good insight into 
the meaning behind this speech.

We can combine all of the above steps into a single pipeline;

```{r}
hamlet %>%
    unnest_tokens(word, text) |>
    anti_join(stop_words) |>
    count(word, sort = TRUE)
```

## Downloading texts

To do more text analysis we need to find some larger texts. Fortunately, the
[gutenbergr](https://docs.ropensci.org/gutenbergr/) package makes it easy
to download books from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org).

```{r}
library(gutenbergr)
```

Lets start by downloading "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes". The Gutenberg
ID of this book is 1661 (found via the [search engine](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/)).

```{r}
sherlock <- gutenberg_download(1661)
sherlock
```

We can now perform the same analysis as above, namely tokenising by word,
removing stop words, and then counting words to find the most common;

```{r}
sherlock %>%
    unnest_tokens(word, text) |>
    anti_join(stop_words) |>
    count(word, sort = TRUE)
```

This has shown all words, including words that only appeared once. We can
narrow this down by using the [filter](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html)
function from [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/index.html) to filter in
only words that appear more than 75 times;

```{r}
counts <- sherlock |>
    unnest_tokens(word, text) |>
    anti_join(stop_words) |>
    count(word, sort = TRUE) |>
    filter(n > 75)
counts
```

To plot this data, we need to convert the words from being stored as text,
to be represented as [factors](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/factors.html).
We do this using the core R [reorder](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/reorder.default)
function. This will order the factors according to the number of occurrences
of each word. As we are changing the tibble, we need to use the dplyr 
[mutate](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html) to edit
the column in place;

```{r}
counts <- counts |> mutate(word = reorder(word, n))
```

The data is now ready to be rendered as a bar graph. We can do this using
[ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org), using the aesthetic of placing
the number of occurrences on the x axis, the word on the y axis,
using a `geom_col()` column plot, and not adding a label on the y-axis;

```{r}
counts |> ggplot(aes(n, word)) + geom_col() + labs(y = NULL)
```

## EXERCISE

Go onto [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org) and find a book that you 
want to analyse. Download the book and create a graph of the most common
words (ignoring stop words).
