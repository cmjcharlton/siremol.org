The below image shows how I've loaded the cats dataset into a 
`data.frame` called `cats`. You can see the dataset information displayed
on the right-hand side of the RStudio window under "Data". This information
also pops up when I type `cats$`, showing the possible completions (i.e. the 
variables available). These are `Sex`, `BodyWeight` and `HeartWeight`.
