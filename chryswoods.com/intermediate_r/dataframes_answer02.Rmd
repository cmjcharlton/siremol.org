```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```R
mean_heart_weight <- calculate_mean(cats$HeartWeight)
mean_body_weight <- calculate_mean(cats$BodyWeight)

max_heart_weight <- calculate_max(cats$HeartWeight)
max_body_weight <- calculate_max(cats$BodyWeight)

cat( sprintf("Heart Weight: mean = %.2f, max = %.2f\n", 
             mean_heart_weight, max_heart_weight) )

cat( sprintf("Body weight: mean = %.2f, max = %.2f\n",
             mean_body_weight, max_body_weight) )
```

should print;

```
Heart Weight: mean = 10.63, max = 20.50
Body weight: mean = 2.72, max = 3.90
```

(note, if you have restarted your R session you will need to 
re-type the `calculate_mean` and `calculate_max` functions.
You can find them in the "History" pane by clicking on the
"History" tab on the top right)
