From the links in the page, the tidyverse packages are;

* [ggplot2](https://ggplot2-book.org) - a package for creating fantastic graphs
and visualisations of tidy data. It is built on the concept of a grammar
for graphics, which, once understood, provides a straightforward and
consistent interface for creating sophisticated graphs and plots of tidy data.
* [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org) - provides an updated version of 
a `data.frame`, the `tibble`, that is more consistent and better-suited
to the needs of modern data science
* [tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org) - provides tools for cleaning and 
manipulating your data so that it becomes "tidy data". The tidyverse is
built on the concept of tidy data. Tidy data is where every column
is a variable, every row is an observation and every cell has a single value.
Typically, real-world data needs to be munged to become tidy, e.g.
via pivoting, rectangling, nesting etc. This package provides the
functions to do this efficiently.
* [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org) - provides an updated version
of R's data reading functions, bringing greater consistency and 
more predictable behaviour.
* [purrr](https://purrr.tidyverse.org) - provides a functional programming
toolkit, e.g. enabling you to perform functions on selected data
within a tibble via mapping.
* [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org) - provides a set of data manipulation
functions arranged around a consistent grammar for data manipulation.
This includes, for example, filtering, selecting, mutating and arranging
data.
* [forcats](https://forcats.tidyverse.org) - provides updated and more
consistent tools for handling R factors (ways of representing 
categorical data).
