```

R is a statistical programming language, designed primarily for 
data analysis and visualisation. Key to this is in-built
support for tables of data. A table of data is called
a `data.frame`. A table has columns, which are given names,
and there are rows, which contain data for each column.

For example, let us create a table that contains animals
and their sounds;

```R
pets <- data.frame(animal = c("cat", "dog", "bird"),
                   sound = c("meow", "woof", "tweet"))
```

This will create a `data.frame` with two columns; `animal`
and `sound`. There are three rows. You can print `pets`
to the screen by typing `print(pets)`, or, just by typing
`pets`, e.g.

```R
pets

  animal sound
1    cat  meow
2    dog  woof
3   bird tweet
```

You can access a column using `$` followed by the column name, 
e.g.

```R
pets$animal

[1] "cat"  "dog"  "bird"

pets$sound

[1] "meow"  "woof"  "tweet"
```

You can also use the index of the column, e.g.

```R
pets[1]

  animal
1    cat
2    dog
3   bird

pets[[1]]

[1] "cat"  "dog"  "bird"
```

The second version (`pets[[1]]`) returns the vector that holds the
data, while the first version (`pets[1]`) returns a `data.frame` that
contains only the first column.

To get a row, you need to add a comma (`,`) after the index, e.g.

```R
pets[1, ]

  animal sound
1    cat  meow

pets[2, ]

  animal sound
2    dog  woof
```

You can access a specific value using `row index, column index`, e.g.

```R
pets[1, 1]

[1] "cat"

pets[1, 2]

[1] "meow"
```

## Reading data tables from files

There are many methods in R that let you read data into a `data.frame`.
We will cover them in much more detail in upcoming workshops.

One such function is `read.csv`. This reads table data from a 
comma-separated file. Each line in the file is a row, with columns
separated by commas.

For example, [cats](https://academic.uprm.edu/wrolke/esma6665/stories.htm#cats) 
is a data set available as a CSV file that contains data about 
cats. You can find a (slightly modified) version of this 
[dataset here](https://chryswoods.com/intermediate_r/data/cats.csv).

`read.csv` can read CSV files from the filesystem (via their file name), 
or, if you have a URL, directly from the internet. To read this
CSV file into a `data.frame` you should type;

```R
cats <- read.csv("https://chryswoods.com/intermediate_r/data/cats.csv")
```
