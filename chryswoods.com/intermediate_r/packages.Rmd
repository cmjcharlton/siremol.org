```

The string formatting in R can feel old fashioned because R is an 
old programming language. R was created in 1995 to be a better
version of an even older programming language called 
[S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language)),
which was created in 1976. The clunkiness of parts of R
when compared to modern languages is due to this heritage.

Fortunately, R is not stuck in the past. R comes with a lot of packages
that extend the core functionality, and provide a more modern
interface to its most powerful functionality. When we use
R with these packages, we are using "modern R".

For example, the [Stringr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/index.html)
package provides a set of modern functions for manipulating and 
formatting strings.

To use `Stringr`, we first need to install the package. You install
packages in R using `install.packages`, e.g. type into your console;

```R
install.packages("stringr")
```

and hit return. If your user account has permission to install packages then
you should see something like;

```
trying URL 'https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/contrib/4.0/stringr_1.4.0.tgz'
Content type 'application/x-gzip' length 210650 bytes (205 KB)
==================================================
downloaded 205 KB


The downloaded binary packages are in
	/var/folders/vg/lyxsq9391fxfm64hfdfr88f40000gq/T//Rtmp57uUY0/downloaded_packages
```

Notice that this will automatically get the right package for your operating
system (in my case `macosx`). Also note that you only have to do this once,
as once installed, this package is available for everyone.

## Using a package

You can use a package in your script via the `library` command. To use
`stringr` you should type;

```R
library(stringr)
```

into the console. When you press return, nothing should happen. If you see
output similar to;

```
Error in library(stringr) : there is no package called ‘stringr’
```

then this means that `stringr` is not installed properly.

To get help on a package type `?` before its name, e.g.

```R
?stringr
```

All of the functions in `stringr` start with `str_` and take 
a string (or vector/list of strings) as the first argument.

Key functions are;

* `str_c` : Modern replacement for `cat`
* `str_length` : Count the number of characters in a string
* `str_sub` : Extract substrings
* `str_trim` : Remove trailing and leading whitespace
* `str_pad` : Pad a string
* `str_wrap` : Wrap a string into a paragraph

## CRAN

The power of R comes from its great wealth of excellent packages. These
packages are managed in a central repository called 
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) (the Comprehensive R Archive Network).
There are very strict protocols to follow to publish a package
in CRAN, which includes an external review stage. As such, publishing
an R package is a lot like publishing a paper, and so R packages
on CRAN are mostly of a high standard, and come complete with 
documentation and tests. You can get an idea of what is needed to
publish a package on CRAN by reading [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org)
by Hadley Wickham and Jennifer Bryan. This excellent online book
provides complete detail of how to write and publish an R package.

A good way to find the package you want is to use an R search
service, such as [rseek](https://rseek.org). You can search
for individual package names, or even the kind of thing you
want to do. As most R packages come with vignettes (web pages
that show examples of how to use the package) this means
you can quickly find both the package that achieves your goal,
plus really clear documentation and examples.

## Updating packages

R's strength is its packages, and what makes this easier is that
package management is handled directly within the language.

You can update a package by running `install.packages` again, e.g.
to update `stringr` to the newest version, just type;

```R
install.packages("stringr")
```

You can get a list of all installed packages via `installed.packages()`,
e.g.

```R
installed.packages()
```

You can get a list of all packages for which new versions are available
using `old.packages()`, e.g.

```R
old.packages()
```

You can update all packages for which updates are available using
`update.packages()`. Set `ask = FALSE` to update everything
without prompting, e.g.

```R
update.packages(ask = FALSE)
```

Note that updating all of your packages could take a while if you haven't
done it recently...
