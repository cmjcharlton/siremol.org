```

It is likely that a lot of the R code in the vignettes you saw 
in the last page did not make sense to you now. Do not worry!
You are new to R and are still near the beginning of your
learning journey. Over the last half of this workshop we
will explore some of the building blocks of R so that 
they will begin to make a little more sense ;-)

A core building block of all programming languages is a
function. A function is a reusable block of code that
can be used over and over again in your program. 
A function takes inputs (called arguments), it then 
does something to those inputs to produce some outputs,
which are returned to you.

You've already used many functions. For example,

```R
library(stringr)
hello <- "Hello R"
length <- str_length(hello)
cat(sprintf("'%s' has %d characters\n", hello, length)) 
```

will print `'Hello R' has 7 characters`.

This code has four functions:

* `library` : This function loads the library passed as the argument,
e.g. `library(stringr)` loads the `stringr` library
* `str_length` : This function calculates the number of characters
in the string passed in as the argument, returning the number of 
characters. When input the value of `hello` (namely `Hello R`) it
returns the number `7`.
* `cat` : This prints its arguments to the screen, returning nothing.
* `sprintf` : This formats a string based on its many input arguments,
returning the string that has been created.

## Writing your own functions

You can write your own functions in R! For example, let's try to
write a function that calculates the mean average of a numeric
vector. This is of course for illustration purposes only
because as you would expect R includes a built-in `mean` function
which you would use instead in real analysis.

As input, the function will take a numeric vector. It should 
output a number which is the mean of those numbers.

There are many ways this function could be written. Here is a 
possible solution;

```R
calculate_mean <- function(values) {
     total <- 0.0
     count <- 0L
     for (value in values) {
         total <- total + value
         count <- count + 1L
     }
     return(total / count)
}
```

We can then use this function, to, e.g. calculate the average
height of a group of people, by typing;

```R
person_heights <- c(1.62, 1.80, 1.56, 1.73, 1.91)

average_height <- calculate_mean(person_heights)

cat(sprintf("The average height is %.2f m\n", average_height))
```

Running this would print;

```
The average height is 1.72 m
```

## Scaffolding

To explain how this worked, we need to look at how this function
was defined. There is some scaffolding that is common to all functions.
First, we define the function name. In R, this is an object that holds
the code of the function. We define this object and bind data to
it in the same way as if this was assigning a number to a numeric
vector, or a string to a character vector, namely using the
syntax `object <- value`:

```R
   Object      assigned  value 
      ↓           ↓      ↓
calculate_average <- function(...
```

Next, we have the keyword `function`, that says that this is some
data that is of type function. This means that the data will contain
code. The arguments to `function` are the arguments you would like
to use as input for your new function. You can provide
a default value for these by using the `=` syntax, as you would
when calling the function.

```R
                     keyword  arguments
                        ↓        ↓
calculate_average <- function(values) {
```

Next, you need the body of the function. This body is the lines
of code that will be run when your function is called. Just like
with `for` loops or `if` statements, the body of code must be
contained within curly brackets if it has more than one statement.

```R
                                  Open curly brackets
                                      ↓
calculate_average <- function(values) {
    # body of the function is the
    # lines of code within the curly brackets
}
↑
Close curly brackets
```

The input(s) for the function is/are the argument(s) that are
passed to `function`, in this case, `values`. 
Our code will loop through all of the values in `values` to 
calculate the mean average. Once we have finished, we reach
the final part of the function, which is `return`. This is
used to return the output of the function back to the caller.
If you omit `return` R will instead return the last value
referenced in the function. The tidyverse style guide recommends
only using return if you want to end the function before
reaching the end, but this is not an opinion shared by all.
I have chosen to ignore this advice here, and the important
thing is to be consistent with your style to help later readers.

```R
                           Input(s)
                             ↓
calculate_mean <- function(values) {
     total <- 0.0
     count <- 0L
     for (value in values) {
         total <- total + value
         count <- count + 1L
     }
     return(total / count)
        ↑
     Return output
}
```

Finally, when we call the function, the arguments that pass
to the function are used as the input. The output is then
returned and assigned to the result object. So, in this case;

```
                Call function      with input(s)
                        ↓             ↓  
average_height <- calculate_mean(person_heights)
     ↑         ↑
  Output     assigned
```

`calculate_mean` is called with `person_heights`. The data referred
to by `person_heights` is passed to `calculate_mean` and in this function
is referred to as `values`. This data is looped over, the mean average
calculated, resulting in an output that is returned at the end of
the function, and assigned to the object `average_height`.

Note that unlike loops the objects that are defined within a function are
not available after it has run unless you explicitly return them. This is because
the function is run within its own local environment.

## Errors

Your function works well, but what would happen if the wrong arguments
were passed? What should we do if someone did this?

```R
result <- calculate_mean(c("cat", "dog", "horse"))
```

If you run this now, you will see that R prints an error;

```
Error in total + value : non-numeric argument to binary operator
```

This isn't very descriptive or helpful. You can control how R will
behave in an error condition by using `stop` or `warning`.

You use `stop` if you want to stop the function from continuing,
and to print an error message for the user. For example,
we could use `is.numeric` to check if the passed in vector is
numeric. If not, then we could `stop`;

```R
calculate_mean <- function(values) {
    if (!is.numeric(values)) {
        stop("Cannot calculate average of non-numeric values")
    }
    total <- 0.0
    count <- 0L
    for (value in values) {
        total <- total + value
        count <- count + 1L
    }
    return(total / count)
}
```

(note that `!` means "not")

Now running;

```R
result <- calculate_mean(c("cat", "dog", "horse"))
```

gives the more useful error message;

```
Error in calculate_mean(c("cat", "dog", "horse")) : 
  Cannot calculate average of non-numeric values
```

However, what if instead of stopping, we want to calculate
the average of any values that could be coerced to numeric, 
and just warn the user if non-numeric values are passed?
This would allow us to pass in a character vector where the
elements are strings representing numbers.
We can do this using the `warning` function, e.g.

```R
calculate_mean <- function(values) {
     total <- 0.0
     count <- 0L
     for (value in values) {
         number <- as.numeric(value)

         if (!is.na(number)) {
             total <- total + number
             count <- count + 1L
         } else {
             warning("Skipping '", value, 
                     "' as it is not numeric")
         }
     }
     return(total / count)
}
```

In this case, we try to convert the value into a number using
the `as.numeric` function. If this fails, it will return `NA`.
We then test for `NA` using the `is.na` function, printing
a warning that we are skipping this value if it isn't a number.

> it warns when non-numeric values are skipped, and stops
> when there is no maximum value (i.e. because there are
> no numeric values passed).
