```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

That's all we have for this workshop. By now you should have a better understanding 
of the building blocks of R and the tidyverse that are used for statistical
programming, data science and data analysis and visualisation.

In this workshop we have covered:

* How to use RStudio, including finding function documentation
* How to make you life easier with string formatting
* How to find, install and load R packages
* What is the tidyverse, and how it is the basis of modern R
* How to read CSV files into tibbles
* How to use forward pipes (`|>`) to chain together data processing functions

## Good development practices

With ever updated package versions and support for a wide variety of different 
platforms, being able to reproduce the original output at a later date can be a
major problem. I suggest reading the article 
[Possible Directions for Improving Dependency Versioning in R](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2013-1/ooms.pdf)
in the R journal to see how this applies to R and its packaging system. Since 
this article was written a number of packages have been written to help with this, 
such as [Groundhog](http://datacolada.org/95), 
[sessioninfo](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/sessioninfo/index.html) and 
[renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html), and solutions 
such as Docker have become more popular. It is much harder to break bad habits
later on so I suggest that consider how you will address this before you write
too much code. This should reduce the likelihood of this becoming a problem when 
your code is re-run in the future (including by yourself).

## What's next?

Once you're comfortable with the material in this course you will be ready to 
start using R and the tidyverse for real data analysis. We will have upcoming
workshops on ["Introduction to Data Analysis with R"](https://chryswoods.com/data_analysis_r/index.html) and 
"Advanced Data Analysis with R" which will be linked here when ready.

Hadley Wickham and the tidyverse project have done an excellent job of producing
lots of great documentation and tutorials for R. I highly recommend reading
the free online books;

* [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham
* [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](https://ggplot2-book.org) by Hadley Wickham, Danielle Navarro, and Thomas Lin Pedersen, and
* [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz) by Hadley Wickham

The best thing about R is the R community. I also strongly recommend you look 
for R meetups, workshops or forums. Notable R communities include;

* [The RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com)
* [The NHS R Community](https://nhsrcommunity.com)
* [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org)

There are many more [community groups listed here](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2017/06/r-community.html).

This workshop was inspired by [Intermediate Python](https://milliams.com/courses/intermediate_python),
although quickly deviated away due to the relative strengths and different application
areas of R and Python.
