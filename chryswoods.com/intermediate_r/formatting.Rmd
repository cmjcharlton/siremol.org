```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Being able to print things to the screen is a fundamental part of 
interacting with a programming language. So far, we've kept it simple 
by passing the data we want to print directly to the `print` function:

```R
my_num <- 42
print(my_num)
```

```
[1] 42
```

We then made things a bit nicer by using `cat`, which doesn't 
automatically add a newline to the output, nor add the 
`[1]` at the beginning, e.g. 

```R
cat(my_num)
```

```
42
```

This was then improved by recognising that `cat` allows 
multiple arguments to be printed, enabling us to combine our data with a message:

```R
cat("My num is", my_num, "\n")
```

```
My num is 42
```

(remembering that `\n` means "newline")

This works perfectly well but firstly you're using the implicit space that's 
added by `cat` as part of your sentence and secondly you're passing in two 
separate pieces of information where they are logically one.

What we can do instead is create a single string which contains the message 
we want to print and put special placeholders inside it where we want our 
data to appear. There's a few different ways to do this in R. For a 
good overview check out [Handling Strings with R](https://www.gastonsanchez.com/r4strings/)
by Gaston Sanchez and Chitra Venkatesh. For research software programming, 
you will typically want complete control, and so the best approach is
to use C-style formatting.

## C-style formatting and `sprintf`

`sprintf` is an interface to the C function `sprintf`. This will create
a string based on a format with some input data. You can get help on this
function by typing into the console;

```R
?sprintf
```

Note that as this function is a direct call into a C function you may find that
its behaviour varies slightly between different platforms, depending on the
underlying C implementation. It is also possible to crash R by providing invalid
input to this function, although the R wrapper does its best to avoid this by
checking the input parameters.

The function works by creating a string with placeholders, such 
as `%s`, `%d` and `%f`, into which it will format data. For example,
type into the console;

```R
cat(sprintf("My num is %d\n", my_num))
```

and hit return. You should see this printed to the screen;

```
My num is 42
```

The placeholder, `%d` is replaced by the value stored in the variable
`my_num`. The `%d` means "format this value as a digit (integer)". Although
`my_num` is being stored as a double type R has recognised that there is 
nothing after the decimal place and automatically coerced it to an integer.
You can also choose to format as a floating point number (`%f`) 
or as a string (`%s`).

For example, if we type;

```R
my_float <- 3.14159
cat(sprintf("A digit: %d, a float: %f.\n", my_num, my_float))
```

we get printed out;

```
A digit: 42, a float: 3.141590.
```

We can even control the width of the numbers, or the number
of values after the decimal point, e.g.

```R
cat(sprintf("Width 8, 3 after decimal point: %8.3f\n", my_float))
```

will print

```
Width 8, 3 after decimal point:    3.142
```

to the screen.

There are a lot of controls, which are
[described well in Handling Strings with R](https://www.gastonsanchez.com/r4strings/c-style-formatting.html).

## Writing to a file

You can use `cat` to write to a file. To do this specify the filename
using the `file` argument. Use `append = TRUE` to append data to an existing
file, or `append = FALSE` to overwrite and write to a new file.

```R
cat("Writing to a new file\n", file = "output.txt")
cat("Appending another line...\n", file = "output.txt", append = TRUE)
```

will write two lines to the new file `output.txt` (in R's current working
directory, which you can check by running `getwd()` in the Console).
