```

As mentioned before, R is an old programming language that was written
as a re-implementation of the even older language, S. Over the years
this has meant that R has gained many different layers and methods
of doing things. This has created lots of inconsistencies and cruft, 
with R sometimes behaving in strange and unexpected ways that can be 
confusing for new users, and not suited to applications in 
modern data science.

The tidyverse is a coherent collection of modern R packages that
solves this problem. It is a coherent system of packages for data manipulation, 
exploration and visualization that share a common design philosophy.
The packages were originally mostly developed by Hadley Wickham,
but have been expanded by several contributers and has now developed
into a thriving and highly supportive community.

Modern R is the tidyverse, and I strongly recommend that you use
the tidyverse when you use R for data science, manipulation and
visualisation.

There is lots of information about the tidyverse on the web, e.g.

* [What is the tidyverse?](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2017/06/08/what-is-the-tidyverse/)
* [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) - an online book by 
Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham that teaches the concepts of 
tidy data and shows how R with the tidyverse will help you create
tidy data workflows.

## Loading the tidyverse

You can install and use the tidyverse by typing;

```R
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

This will download and then import the tidyverse modules. You should
see something similar to this printed;

```
── Attaching packages ────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.0 ──
✓ ggplot2 3.3.2     ✓ purrr   0.3.4
✓ tibble  3.0.3     ✓ dplyr   1.0.2
✓ tidyr   1.1.2     ✓ forcats 0.5.0
✓ readr   1.3.1     
── Conflicts ───────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()
```

This shows that the seven core tidyverse modules have been loaded
([ggplot2](https://ggplot2-book.org), [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org),
[tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org), [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org),
[purrr](https://purrr.tidyverse.org), [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org)
and [forcats](https://forcats.tidyverse.org)).

It also shows how the modern `dplyr::filter` and `dplyr::lag`
functions replace the older `stats::filter` and 
`stats::lag` functions.

## Tibbles and readr

We will learn and use the tidyverse in much more depth in future 
workshops. For today, we will look at `tibble`. A `tibble` is the
modern tidyverse version of a `data.frame`. A `tibble` is a `data.frame`,
and so can be used in the same way. But it comes with more powerful
features and removes inconsistent and confusing behaviour.

In the same way, `readr` provides modern tidyverse replacements 
for R's standard reading functions. `readr` provides `read_csv`,
which is a better way of reading csv files than R's standard
`read.csv`.

Let's now use the tidyverse to `read_csv` the cats data set
into a `tibble`.

```R
cats <- read_csv("https://chryswoods.com/intermediate_r/data/cats.csv")
```

The first thing you will notice is that the tidyverse has printed
out some useful information;

```
Parsed with column specification:
cols(
  Sex = col_character(),
  BodyWeight = col_double(),
  HeartWeight = col_double()
)
```

This is telling you that `read_csv` found three columns; `Sex`, which 
is treated as a columns of strings (characters), and 
`BodyWeight` and `HeartWeight`, which are both treated as columns
of floating point numbers (doubles).

Next, if you type `cats` and press return...

```R
cats
# A tibble: 144 x 3
   Sex   BodyWeight HeartWeight
   <chr>      <dbl>       <dbl>
 1 F            2           7  
 2 F            2           7.4
 3 F            2           9.5
 4 F            2.1         7.2
 5 F            2.1         7.3
 6 F            2.1         7.6
 7 F            2.1         8.1
 8 F            2.1         8.2
 9 F            2.1         8.3
10 F            2.1         8.5
# … with 134 more rows
```

You can see that the `tibble` summarises itself to the screen. 
This makes it much easier to quickly look at some data without 
it overflowing your console.

As a `tibble` is a `data.frame`, you can use the same methods
of accessing data, e.g.

```R
cats$Bodyweight
```

```

```

```R
cats[1, ]
```

```
# A tibble: 1 x 3
  Sex   BodyWeight HeartWeight
  <chr>      <dbl>       <dbl>
