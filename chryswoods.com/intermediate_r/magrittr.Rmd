```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

The tidyverse makes heavy use of the R concept of 
forward pipes. Forward pipes, represented via `%>%`,
are provided by the 
[magrittr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html)
package, which should be automatically loaded by the tidyverse.

(if not, you can load it via `load.packages("magrittr")`)

A forward pipe forwards the variable on the left into
the first argument to the function on the right, e.g.

```R
"kitten" %>% print()
```

will forward the string "kitten" so that it is the first 
argument to the function `print`. Hence this is exactly
identical to

```R
print("kitten")
```

and so

```
[1] "kitten"
```

is printed.

You may ask why this is useful? It is useful because it enables
you to chain together a lot of functions. For example, the 
tidyverse [dply](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org) package
provides the function `filter`, for filtering data.

So;

```R
cats %>% filter(Sex == "F")
```

```
# A tibble: 47 x 3
   Sex   BodyWeight HeartWeight
   <chr>      <dbl>       <dbl>
 1 F            2           7  
 2 F            2           7.4
 3 F            2           9.5
 4 F            2.1         7.2
 5 F            2.1         7.3
 6 F            2.1         7.6
 7 F            2.1         8.1
 8 F            2.1         8.2
 9 F            2.1         8.3
10 F            2.1         8.5
# â€¦ with 37 more rows
```

has filtered the cats data set from the last page to return
a `tibble` that contains data only for female cats.

This was identical to typing;

```R
filter(cats, Sex == "F")
```

The power comes that we can now chain filters, e.g.

```R
cats %>% filter(Sex == "F") %>% filter(BodyWeight > 2.5)
```

```
# A tibble: 11 x 3
   Sex   BodyWeight HeartWeight
   <chr>      <dbl>       <dbl>
 1 F            2.6         8.7
 2 F            2.6        10.1
 3 F            2.6        10.1
 4 F            2.7         8.5
 5 F            2.7        10.2
 6 F            2.7        10.8
 7 F            2.9         9.9
 8 F            2.9        10.1
 9 F            2.9        10.1
10 F            3          10.6
11 F            3          13  
```

We can then use the [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org) 
`summarise` function to call `calculate_mean` on a specified
row of this filtered data, e.g.

```R
cats %>% 
    filter(Sex == "F") %>% 
    filter(BodyWeight > 2.5) %>% 
    summarise(mean = calculate_mean(HeartWeight))
```

will output

```
# A tibble: 1 x 1
   mean
  <dbl>
1  10.2
```

as the mean average of the heart weight in grams of female cats whose
body weight is greater than 2.5 kg.

Note how we have split this over multiple lines, putting
the forward pipe `%>%` at the end so that it is clear that the line continues
(use Shift+Enter to start a new line without running the command in the
R Console).

To save this to a variable, we would use the assign `<-` as normal, 
hence the full code should be;

```R
average_heart_weight <- cats %>%
    filter(Sex == "F") %>%
    filter(BodyWeight > 2.5) %>%
    summarise(mean = calculate_mean(HeartWeight)) %>%
    pull()
```

Yes, this is a very dense bit of code. This is typical for R. You will 
often see very dense blocks of code that use forward pipes to push
data through several functions, resulting in a final output result.
As you can see, it is important that you name your variables, data,
columns and functions clearly, so that it is easier for future 
readers of your code to understand what is going on. 

Finally, note that we have used the `pull` function to extract the final answer
from a 1x1 `tibble` into a scalar before storing it into`average_heart_weight`.
