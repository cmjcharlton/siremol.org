```

Everything we've done so far has been completely self-contained in the 
script and every time we run any of them we will get exactly the same output. 
The power of programming is to be able to take the same piece of code and 
apply it to different data to get different results. One common way in 
which this is done is writing a script which can analyse a data file. 
To do that we need to learn how to open files.

The simplest this we can do with files is read a file in and print it 
to the screen. Make a new script called `file.R` and put the following in it:

```R
file_handle <- file("file.R")
file_lines <- readLines(file_handle)
close(file_handle)

for (file_line in file_lines) {
  print(file_line)
}
```

when you run it with `Rscript file.R` you will see it print out:

```
[1] "file_handle <- file(\"file.R\")"
[1] "file_lines <- readLines(file_handle)"
[1] "close(file_handle)"
[1] ""
[1] "for (file_line in file_lines) {"
[1] "  print(file_line)"
[1] "}"
```

which is (somewhat recursively) the contents of the file `file.R`

There are a few new things here so let's go through them in turn. The first 
thing is to describe the connection to the file. This is specified by
`file("file.R")`, which creates a connection to the file called `file.R`.

Next, the `readLines` function is used to open the file and read all 
of the lines. These are returned as a character vector, which we assign to a 
variable called `file_lines`, via `file_lines <- readLines(file("file.R"))`.

If this file does not exist, then `readLines` will print an error
and exit the script, e.g.

```R
file_handle <- file("does_not_exist.R")
file_lines <- readLines(file_handle)
close(file_handle)
```

```
Rscript file.R

Error in readLines(file_handle) : cannot open the connection
In addition: Warning message:
In readLines(file_handle) :
  cannot open file 'does_not_exist.R': No such file or directory
Execution halted
```

If the file does exist, then it is opened and all of its lines read into 
memory. If you forget to close the file then R will close it automatically
(with a warning) some time after there are no longer any references to the
connection or when the script ends.

In the next line (`for (file_line in file_lines)`) we are looping over the lines 
of the file. This loop looks just like those we used when looping over 
lists a few chapters previously, because `lines` is just a list containing
the lines of the file. We assign the string containing the line from the 
file to the variable `file_line`.

Finally, we print the string `file_line`. Note that R will automatically
add quotes and backslashes to the lines that are printed. You can 
remove them by passing `quote = FALSE` to `print`, e.g.

```R
file_handle <- file("file.R")
file_lines <- readLines(file_handle)
close(file_handle)

for (file_line in file_lines) {
  print(file_line, quote = FALSE)
}
```

will print

```
[1] file_handle <- file("file.R")
[1] file_lines <- readLines(file_handle)
[1] close(file_handle)
[1] 
[1] for (file_line in file_lines) {
[1]   print(file_line, quote = FALSE)
[1] }
```

If you want to remove the `[1]` at the start of each line, then you can print
to the screen using `cat`, specifying that a newline (`\n`) should be 
used to separate each line, e.g.

```R
file_handle <- file("file.R")
file_lines <- readLines(file_handle)
close(file_handle)

for (file_line in file_lines) {
  cat(file_line, sep = "\n")
}
```

will print the file exactly.

## Data type conversion

Simply reading the data and printing it isn't very useful. Let's take a 
first step towards some data analysis and pretend that the task we're 
trying to do is to read in data from the file and add 17 to each value.

```R
file_handle <- file("data.txt")
file_lines <- readLines(file_handle)
close(file_handle)

for (file_line in file_lines) {
  new_number <- file_line + 17
  print(new_number)
}
```

If you edit `file.R` to contain this code and run it you should see an error:

```
Error in file_line + 17 : non-numeric argument to binary operator
Execution halted
```

This is telling us that there is an error occurring when trying to add 17 to the 
data read in from the line in the file. The error message says that there is
a "non-numeric argument to a binary operator", which implies that the computer 
believes that we're trying to add together something that is not a numeric
value. The only two things involved in this operation are `file_line` and `17`. 
We know that `17` is an integer, and so is a numeric, so `file_line` must be 
the problematic non-numeric argument.

When reading from a file like this, everything it gives you will *always* 
be a string, even if the string only contains digits like "12". If we know 
that the file only contains numerics, then we can convert each number 
to a numeric as it comes in using the `as.numeric` function: 

```R
file_handle <- file("data.txt")
file_lines <- readLines(file_handle)
close(file_handle)

for (file_line in file_lines) {
  number <- as.numeric(file_line)
  new_number <- number + 17
  print(new_number)
}
```

Running this new script will now print out our "processed" data:

```
[1] 29
[1] 71
[1] 24
[1] 349
[1] 71
[1] 18
[1] 17
```
