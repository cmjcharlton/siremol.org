```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Starting with creating our data file `data.txt`:

```
12
54
7
332
54
1
0
```

We then write a short script to open the data file, loop over its 
lines and print each in-turn. The only thing that has been changed 
here is the argument being passed to `file`:

```R
file_lines <- readLines("data.txt")

for (file_line in file_lines) {
  cat(file_line, sep = "\n")
}
```

```
Rscript file.R

```
