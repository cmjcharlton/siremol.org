```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Starting with creating our data file data.txt:

```
12
54
7
332
54
1
0
```

As before we start with defining an scalar `count` to start at zero. 
We increase it by 1 each time around the loop and print it out at the end:

```R
file_lines <- readLines("data.txt")

total <- 0
count <- 0L

for (file_line in file_lines) {
  number <- as.numeric(file_line)
  total <- total + number
  count <- count + 1L
}

print(paste("Sum of all", count, "values is:", total))
```

```
Rscript file.R

[1] "Sum of all 7 values is: 460"
```
