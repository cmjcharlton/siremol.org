```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

We make two strings. One called `first_phrase` and second called `second_phrase`. 
We then make a third called `message` by pasting together (using the 
`paste` function) the other two. This combines the strings together into a new, 
longer string:

```R
first_phrase <- "The Battle of Hastings"
second_phrase <- "was in 1066"

message <- paste(first_phrase, second_phrase)

print(message)
```

Again, when we run our code, the output has not changed, as expected:

```
Rscript hello.R

[1] "The Battle of Hastings was in 1066"
```
