```

Lists let you store lots of variables, and to access them by their location 
in the list. However, there are times when you want to store lots of variables, 
but access them using more complex relationships. One example is a dictionary, 
which lets you store variables and access them using a key.

Dictionaries in R are created by associating names (keys) with elements
in a list. You thus create them using the same combine (`c`) function 
as used to create a list.  Make a new file called `dict.R` and put this in it:

```R
sounds <- c("cat"="meow", "dog"="woof", "horse"="neigh")

cat_sound <- sounds["cat"]

print(cat_sound)
```

Running that script, you should see 

```   
cat 
"meow" 
```

printed to the screen.

What we did here was create a dictionary by adding names (keys) to the items
in the list. The three items in the list are `meow`, `woof` and `neigh`. We have
added names (keys) using the syntax `name=value`, so `meow` is given the name `cat`,
`woof` is named `dog` and `neigh` is named `horse`.

The value is the real data that we want to keep hold of and the name (also called key) 
is how we can get at the data we want. The key and value are separated by an
equals sign, and each key-value pair is separated by a comma.

On the next line we access the data in the dictionary sounds. Again, 
like lists we use the square brackets to ask questions of our data. In 
this case we're asking the dictionary to give us the value associated with 
the key `cat` and so it will return to us `meow`.

Since dictionaries can be quite large and it can sometimes be hard to see 
which parts are keys and which are values, it is possible to write 
dictionaries over multiple lines, one line per key-value item:

```R
sounds <- c(
  "cat"="meow", 
  "dog"="woof", 
  "horse"="neigh"
)

cat_sound <- sounds["cat"]

print(cat_sound)
```

Note that an R dictionary is just a list with named elements. This means you
can still access the items by index, e.g. `sounds[1]` will return `cat`.
This also means that you don't need to name every element!

Also note that 

```
cat
"meow"
```

was printed to the screen as the value with its name (key) is returned.
To get the value alone, you need to use `as.character` if the value
is a string, or `as.numeric` if the value is a number, e.g.

```R
sounds <- c(
  "cat"="meow",
  "dog"="woof",
  "horse"="neigh"
)

cat_sound <- sounds["cat"]

print(as.character(cat_sound))
```

would print

```
[1] "meow"
```

## Adding new data into dictionaries

As with lists, dictionaries are dynamic so we can add entries into a dictionary.
Let's say that we want to add in a new sound for a cow into our sounds dictionary. 
The key that the data will have will be "cow" and the value will be "moo". 
To do so we put `sounds["cow"]` on the left-hand side of a variable assignment 
expression, as if we're making a new variable. On the right goes the data 
that we want to put into the dictionary:

```R
sounds <- c(
    "cat"="meow",
    "dog"="woof",
    "horse"="neigh"
)

sounds["cow"] <- "moo"

print(sounds)
```

This is saying that we want the append the value `moo` onto the end of `sounds`, and to then
associated it with the name (key) `cow`. This should print;

```
    cat     dog   horse     cow 
 "meow"  "woof" "neigh"   "moo" 
```

## Looping over dictionaries

When discussing `for` loops you were told that R allows you to loop over lots 
of different types of data such as lists and sequences. Since a dictionary is
just a list (vector) with names, we can loop over dictionaries too.

To discover how it works, let's do the na√Øve thing first and just see what 
happens when we loop over a dictionary:

```R
sounds <- c(
    "cat"="meow",
    "dog"="woof",
    "horse"="neigh"
)

for (thing in sounds){
    print(thing)
}
```

If you put this code into a file called `dict_loop.R` and run it you should see:

```
[1] "meow"
[1] "woof"
[1] "neigh"
```

Hopefully, you recognise those as the values from the dictionary. 
So, it seems that when looping over a dictionary we will be given the *values*.
This makes sense, as a dictionary is just a list with named values.

What if, for example, you wanted to loop over the *names* (keys) instead. 
Well, there is a function called `names` which gives you just those so 
that you can loop over them:

```R
sounds <- c(
    "cat"="meow",
    "dog"="woof",
    "horse"="neigh"
)

for (thing in names(sounds)){
    print(thing)
}
```

will print:

```
[1] "cat"
[1] "dog"
[1] "horse"
```

If we want to loop over the dictionary and get both the keys and the values,
we can remember that a dictionary is just a list. Thus we can get both the name
and value by looking up the item by its numeric index:

```R
sounds <- c(
  "cat"="meow",
  "dog"="woof",
  "horse"="neigh"
)

for (i in seq(1,length(sounds))){
  sound <- sounds[i]
  print(paste(names(sound), "goes", sound))
}
```

The `length` function gives the number of items in the dictionary, which is passed
to `seq` to generate a sequence of all of the numeric indices. For each index
we look up the `sound` as `sounds[i]`. This contains both the value (e.g.
`meow`) and an associated name (e.g. `cat`). The name is extracted using
the `names` function.
