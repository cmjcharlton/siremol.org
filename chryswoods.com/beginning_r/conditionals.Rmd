```{r setup, include = FALSE}

```

We've seen loops are one way of changing the default "top to bottom" 
reading of R scripts. Loops are an example of control flow statements. 
Another very useful tool in R is the conditional. This, rather than allowing 
you to repeat parts of the program, gives you the ability to skip parts 
depending on certain conditions.

The simplest place to start is the `if` statement. This lets you only run a 
block of code if a certain condition is true. Copy the following code 
into a file called if.R and run it with `Rscript if.R` in the terminal:

```R
my_number <- 128

if (my_number > 100) {
    print(paste(my_number, "is large"))
} else if (my_number < 0) {
    print(paste(my_number, "is negative"))
} else {
    print(paste(my_number, "is not large"))
}
```

You should see it print `[1] "128 is large"`

## `if` statement syntax

An `if` statement has a similar sort of structure to a `for` loop in that it 
has scaffolding as well as user-supplied parts. The scaffolding is the 
word `if` and the curly brackets again:

```
 ↓                   ↓
if (my_number > 100) {
    print(paste(my_number, "is large"))
}
```

and the user-supplied part is the conditional, which must be placed within round
brackets;

```
          ↓
if (my_number > 100) {
    print(paste(my_number, "is large"))
}
```

As before, the body must be contained with an open and closed curly brackets

```
                 open curly bracket                
                     ↓
if (my_number > 100) {
    print(paste(my_number, "is large"))
}
↑
close curly bracket
```

## Booleans

If we take a closer look at that user-supplied conditional we'll see it's made up 
of three parts; some data on either side of a greater-than sign (`>`). 
In R this means "is `my_number` more than 100?". It's asking a question and 
in R the answer to a question like this can be either `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

Make a new file called `boolean.R`, write the following in it and run it 
with `Rscript boolean.R`:

```R
print(128 > 100)
```

You should see it print `TRUE`. These are booleans and the question 
`128 > 100` is a boolean statement. `TRUE` and `FALSE` are values in 
the same way that `12` and `"Hello"` are values but belong to their own data type.

Other boolean operations we can perform are:

```R
334 < 98  # Less than
76 == 70 + 6  # Are they equal to each other?
3.14159 != 22/7  # Are they *not* equal to each other
```

## `else`

We've just seen that the body of an `if` statement will only run if the 
conditional is `TRUE`. But what if we want to do one thing if 
it's true, but another if it's false? We can do this by attaching 
an `else` statement to the if statement:

```R
my_number <- 128

if (my_number > 100) {
    print(paste(my_number, "is large"))
} else {
    print(paste(my_number, "is not large"))
}
```

The `else` statement must be on the same line as the closing curly bracket
of the code block in the if keyword. It does not have any option for the 
user to provide a boolean statement to it. In this case, you can guarantee 
that one and only one of the two bodies will run.

## `else if`

If you *do* want to provide a boolean statement to an else then you 
can use an `else if` instead. It stands for "else, if ..." and it 
allows you to refine the questions you are asking:

```R
my_number <- 128

if (my_number > 100) {
    print(paste(my_number, "is large"))
} else if (my_number < 0) {
    print(paste(my_number, "is negative"))
} else {
    print(paste(my_number, "is not large"))
}
```

Note that the `else if` must be on the same line as the closing curly
bracket of the `if` statement.

You can again rely on at most one of the branches being run.
