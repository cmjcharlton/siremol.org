```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

The variables `first_phrase` and `second_phrase` are almost unchanged. 
We pass these two variables as two arguments to `paste()`, separating them by commas
straight to `print`. As before, this will automatically add spaces between each argument 
when displaying the output.

```R
first_phrase <- "The Battle of Hastings"
second_phrase <- "was in 1066"

print(paste(first_phrase, second_phrase))
```

Once more, when we run our code, the output has not changed, as expected:

```
Rscript hello.R

[1] "The Battle of Hastings was in 1066"
```
