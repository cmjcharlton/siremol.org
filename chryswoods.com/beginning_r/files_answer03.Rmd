```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Starting with creating our data file data.txt:

```
12
54
7
332
54
1
0
```

We start by defining an scalar, `total` to be zero before the loop. 
Inside the loop we add the line of code `total <- total + number` which 
increases the scalar `total` by the value in the scalar `number`.
Finally we print the total:

```R
file_lines <- readLines("data.txt")

total <- 0

for (file_line in file_lines) {
  number <- as.numeric(file_line)
  total <- total + number
}

print(paste("Sum of all values is:", total))
```

```
Rscript file.R

[1] "Sum of all values is: 460"
```
