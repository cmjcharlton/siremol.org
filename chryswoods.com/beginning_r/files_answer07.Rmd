```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Starting with creating our data file data.txt:

```
12
54
7
332
54
1
0
```

The logic in this script is identical but instead of having `total`, 
`count` and `mean` as separate variables, we have collected them 
into a single dictionary:

```R
lines <- readLines(file("data.txt"))

stats <- c("sum" = 0, "count" = 0)

for (line in lines) {
  number <- as.numeric(line)
  stats["sum"] <- stats["sum"] + number
  stats["count"] <- stats["count"] + 1
}

if (stats["count"] > 0) {
  stats["mean"] <- stats["sum"] / stats["count"]
}

print(stats)
```

```
Rscript file.R

      sum     count      mean 
460.00000   7.00000  65.71429
```
