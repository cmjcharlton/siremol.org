```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```R
sounds <- hashtab()
sounds[["cat"]] <- "meow"
sounds[["dog"]] <- "woof"
sounds[["horse"]] <- "neigh"

dog_sound <- sounds[["dog"]]
horse_sound <- sounds[["horse"]]

print(paste("Dog goes", dog_sound))
print(paste("Horse goes", horse_sound))
```

```
Rscript dict.R

[1] "Dog goes woof"
[1] "Horse goes neigh"
```

If we edit our script so that it asks for a name that doesn't exist, 
we will see that is returns `NULL`.

```R
sounds <- hashtab()
sounds[["cat"]] <- "meow"
sounds[["dog"]] <- "woof"
sounds[["horse"]] <- "neigh"

fish_sound <- sounds["fish"]

print(paste("Fish goes", fish_sound))
```

```
Rscript dict.R

[1] "Fish goes NULL"
```

As we have seen before, returning `NULL` for a non-existent value can be a 
source of bugs. We should therefore make sure that we test the return value
before attempting to use it

```R
sounds <- hashtab()
sounds[["cat"]] <- "meow"
sounds[["dog"]] <- "woof"
sounds[["horse"]] <- "neigh"

fish_sound <- sounds[["fish"]]
if (!is.null(fish_sound)) {
    print(paste("Fish goes", fish_sound))
} else {
    print("What sounds does a fish make?")
}
```

```
Rscript dict.R

[1] "What sounds does a fish make?"
```
