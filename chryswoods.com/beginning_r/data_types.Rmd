## Strings

In the last chapter we introduced the idea of "strings". They are a way of 
representing normal human words inside an R script. Strings start and end with 
double quotes (") e.g.,

```R
"Hello from R"
```

is a string with three words and an exclamation mark as content.
Strings can contain numbers as well:

```R
"The Battle of Hastings was in 1066"
```

and they can even be empty:

```R
""
```

It is possible in R to also use single quotes (') to make strings, 
as long as the string starts and ends with the same type of quote, 
but it is convention to prefer double quotes.

## Numbers

The other most common type of data that you'll find in R scripts are numbers. 
There are two main types of number in R:

* **Floats** (or floating point numbers) are a way of representing numbers with decimal places
* **Integers** are for representing whole numbers

When creating numbers in R, you do not use quotes, you write the number directly. So:

```R
3.14159
```

is a float, and

```R
42
```

is an integer.

## Variables

Of course, it not much use to have numbers and strings floating about with no 
connection to each other. We want to be able to give them names and combine 
them together. We assign names to data using `<-` (less than, followed by 
a hyphen). For example if we want to make some data and give it a name we can do it like:

```R
pi <- 3.14159
```

This has created a number `3.14159` and given it a name, `pi`. We can now use 
this name in other parts of the program to refer to that piece of data:

```R
print(pi)
```

Names in R can contain upper and lower case letters, numbers and underscores 
(but can't start with a number). Choosing the correct name for a particular 
variable is an important task as a non-descriptive name (or worse, 
an incorrect name) will be very confusing for you and anyone reading your code. 
It is common in R to name your variables with all lower case letters and 
use underscores to separate words.

So, for a variable which contains a number representing a distance in miles, 
avoid shortened names like dm, distm or d and instead use a name like distance_in_miles. 
Remember, code will be written once but read many times so make it easy to read.

Note that R uses `<-` to mean "assign a value to a variable". This is different
to many other programming languages, which use `=` for this meaning. R does
support the use of `=`, e.g.

```R
pi = 3.14159
```

but its use is discouraged.

## Combining variables

Variables are more that just a way of labelling data, they also make it easier 
to do things with your data. If you have some numbers you can add, subtract, 
multiply and divide them as you would expect. The symbol for multiplication 
is `*` and the symbol for division is `/`.

```R
distance_in_miles <- 30
distance_in_km <- distance_in_miles * 1.60934

print(distance_in_km)
```

Here we created a variable `distance_in_miles` with the value of `30`. 
Then we used that variable in line two and multiplied it by a number 
(`distance_in_miles * 1.60934`) and assigned the result of that 
calculation to a new variable called `distance_in_km`. Finally, we 
printed out the new variable.

Likewise we can do addition:

```R
temperature_in_celsius <- 25.1
temperature_in_kelvin <- temperature_in_celsius + 273.15

print(temperature_in_kelvin)
```

We cannot use mathematical operations on strings. They can only be used
on numbers (numeric data). To join strings, we use the `paste` function;


```R
greeting <- "Hello"
name <- "R"

message <- paste(greeting, name)

print(message)
```

## Printing multiple things

So far we've been giving the `print` function a single argument to 
print a single thing. We can print many things at once if we use 
the `paste` function to join many things into a single string.
Arguments to functions in R are separated by commas. 
The `paste` function is designed so that it will join together each of 
the arguments it was provided with, one after another on the same 
line, separated by spaces.

```R
print(paste("Hello", "R"))
```

will print `Hello R`.
