```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

We make a list and then select a few slices of it:

```R
my_list <- list(3L, 5L, "green", 5.3, "house", 100L, 1L)

print(my_list[seq(from = 2, to = 4)])
print(my_list[seq(from = 3, to = 5)])
print(my_list[seq(from = 1, to = 1)])
print(my_list[seq(from = 1, to = 7, by = 2)])
print(my_list[seq(from = 7, to = 1)])
```

This selects everything from the number 2 index up to and including the number 4 index, 
i.e. the 2, 3 and 4 indexes:

```R
seq(from = 2, to = 4)
```

This starts at index 3 and goes as far as index 5:

```R
seq(from = 3, to = 5)
```

This starts at the beginning of the list and stops at index 1, 
giving us a list with just one item:

```R
seq(from = 1, to = 1)
```

This starts at index 1, and goes up to index 7 in steps of 2 
(so all the odd indexes)

```R
seq(from = 1, to = 7, by = 2)
```

This starts at index 7 and goes down to index 1 in steps of -1
(thus reversing the list)

```R
seq(from = 7, to = 1)
```
