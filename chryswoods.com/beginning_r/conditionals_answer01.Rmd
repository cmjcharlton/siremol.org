```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```R
my_number <- 74

if (my_number > 100) {
    print(paste(my_number, "is large"))
} else if (my_number < 0) {
    print(paste(my_number, "is negative"))
} else {
    print(paste(my_number, "is not large"))
}
```

If `my_number` is smaller than `100` and not negative then the first two
expressions are `FALSE` and so the final `else` is triggered and 
"74 is not large" is printed:

```
Rscript if.R

[1] "74 is not large"
```
