Well done for getting this far! We've covered a lot in this course:

* RStudio (introduction)
* The `print()` function
* Basic data types: strings and numerics (floats and integers)
* Indexing, slicing and appending to lists
* Branching logic using `if` statements
* Looping over different data structures such as lists, sequences, dictionaries and files
* Creating, modifying and accessing dictionaries
* Reading files

You're not expected to have committed all of this to memory already, 
learning any programming language takes more than three hours. It is 
only by continuing to use R and practise that you will become confident. 
These notes will remain online so feel free to refer back to them at any time.

> EXERCISE
>
> Let's end this session with a more difficult challenge. We're going to make 
> a calculator which can read numerical operations from a file and print the 
> answers to the screen.
>
> Start by making a file called `calc.txt` with the following contents:
>
> 4 * 6
>
> 5 + 6
> 
> 457 - 75
>
> 54 / 3
>
> 4 + 6
>
> Make sure that you have the spaces between each number and the operator.
>
> Write a program which reads in that file and performs the mathematical 
> operations listed. It should output something like:
>
> 4 * 6 is 24
> 
> 5 + 6 is 11
>
> 457 - 75 is 382
>
> 54 / 3 is 18.0
> 
> 4 + 6 is 10
>
> There are some extra functions that you may need;
>
> `strsplit(line, " ")[[1]]` will split a line of text into words 
> and will return a list of those words.
>
> `cat(line, "is", value, "\n")` will print values to the screen,
> while adding a newline onto the end of each line.

This workshop has given you a beginning introduction on R as a programming
language. This, together with our [Intermediate R](https://chryswoods.com/intermediate_r)
should provide you with a firm foundation as you continue
to learn R and apply it for statistical programming and data science
applications.

If you'd like to learn more R take a look at this excellent book by 
Hadley Wickham:

* [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/index.html) - this book is a great way
to learn more about R as a programming language.
* [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) - this book is a brilliant
introduction on how to use R for data science.

Once you have completed this workshop and [Intermediate R](https://chryswoods.com/intermediate_r),
you will be ready to take are future workshops, [Introduction to Data Analysis in R](https://chryswoods.com/data_analysis_r)
and "Applied Data Analysis in R". These will be linked here once they 
are ready.
