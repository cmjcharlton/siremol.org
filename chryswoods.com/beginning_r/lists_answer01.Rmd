```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

We have changed our list by adding two more items to the end of it. 
Each is still separated by a comma:

```R
my_list <- list("cat", "dog", 261L, "hello", 5.76)

print(my_list)
```

```
RScript list.R

[[1]]
[1] "cat"

[[2]]
[1] "dog"

[[3]]
[1] 261

[[4]]
[1] "hello"

[[5]]
[1] 5.76
```

Here we edit our list so that the items are all in a different order:

```R
my_list <- list(261L, "hello", 5.76, "cat", "dog")

print(my_list)
```

```
Rscript list.R

[[1]]
[1] 261

[[2]]
[1] "hello"

[[3]]
[1] 5.76

[[4]]
[1] "cat"

[[5]]
[1] "dog"
```
