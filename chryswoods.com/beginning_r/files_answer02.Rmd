```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Starting with creating our data file data.txt:

```
12
54
7
332
54
1
0
```

We have changed just one line so that it now has `* 10` rather than `+ 17`:

```R
file_handle <- file("data.txt")
file_lines <- readLines(file_handle)
close(file_handle)

for (file_line in file_lines) {
  number <- as.numeric(file_line)
  new_number <- number * 10
  print(new_number)
}
```

```
Rscript file.R

[1] 120
[1] 540
[1] 70
[1] 3320
[1] 540
[1] 10
[1] 0
```
