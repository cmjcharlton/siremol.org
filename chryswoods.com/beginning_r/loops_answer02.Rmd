```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

We start with the same list we had in the chapter.

```R
words <- c("Hello", "R")

for (word in words) {
    print(word)
}
```

Each item in the list gets printed on its own line:

```
Rscript loop.R

[1] "Hello"
[1] "R"
```

If we loop over a sequence:

```R
words <- c("Hello", "R")

num_words = length(words)

for (i in seq(1, num_words)) {
    print(words[i])
}
```

```
Rscript loop.R

[1] "Hello"
[1] "R"
```

we see again that we have printed each word, but this time we have
looped over the list indices as a sequence.
